# Shell-scripting-mini-project.
This project demonstrates how to create and execute shell scripts for performing repetitative tasks.

# Shell Scripting

### Shell scripting is like writing a recipe for your computer to follow - it's a way to automate tasks by putting commands in a file that your operating system can execute. 

## Basic Components of a Shell Script

* The Shebang (#!). This tells the system which interpreter to use, like specifying which chef will follow your recipe.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

* Commands. These are the actual instructions, like steps in your recipe.

* Variables. Containers to store information that might change.
